# ML in Fraud detection 

**By [Abhinav Sharma]**

Welcome! This portfolio showcases my hands-on data science and machine learning projects in the Fraud domain. These projects tackle real-world challenges, from spotting fraud to understanding complex data. I combine technical skills with practical insights to create solutions that make a real difference. I will add the projects as I'd complete them. 

## Why This Portfolio?

Data is everywhere, and making sense of it is crucial. This portfolio demonstrates how I use data science to solve important problems, focusing on practical applications and clear results.

## What I Bring to the Table

* **Complete Project Work:** Every project covers all steps, from understanding the data and preparing it, to building models, checking their performance, and explaining how they work.
* **Real-World Focus:** My solutions are designed to address actual business needs.
* **Broad Skills:** My portfolio includes various data science techniques, from standard machine learning to advanced methods like deep learning and explainable AI.
* **Results-Driven:** Projects highlight clear outcomes, easy-to-understand visuals, and useful business value.
* **Clear Communication:** I can explain complex findings and methods clearly to anyone, whether they are technical experts or not.

## My Projects

### Project 1: DeepFake Detection
* Worked on two distinct machine learning strategies (CNNs) for detecting deepfakes (images)
* Precision: A solid 0.94. So, when it says something's fake, it's usually right!

### Project 2: Detecting transactional Fraud
* Design, train, and rigorously evaluate machine learning models capable of automatically identifying fraudulent activity.  Random Forrest
* The model with 100 trees and max_depth=3 performed the best overall. It achieved the highest precision (0.1071) and F1-score (0.1912), while maintaining a very high recall (0.8878) and a competitive ROC-AUC (0.9375).
